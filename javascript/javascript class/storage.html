        //  storage - two types. 1. localStorage, 2. sessionStorage.
        // localStorage - stores data in browser. The data will be deleted only if it is manually deleted

        // real-time example - Swiggy app -  all the items added to the cart can be stored in broswer using localStorage
        //  instead of storing it in database. This data will remain even after user visits the site after a long time. 
        //  Or the data will stay unless and until user deletes.
        
        //  sessionStorage - stores data in broswer. But, the data gets deleted
                                    //   when the user closes the tab or entire browser. 

        // real-time example - Swiggy app -  when user browses and reaches the cart page, all the browsed items 
        // can be shown as suggestions below the cart items. This data will be deleted once the browser is closed. 
        // The next time users open the app, his browsing data differs. based on the browsed data, 
        // suggestion can be shown again.

        localStorage.setItem('name','priya')
        localStorage.getItem('name')
        localStorage.removeItem('name')
        localStorage.clear()
        // incase you are storing objects or arrays, do it differently.
        let item = {
            product: "biriyani",
            quantity: 2,
            price: 222
        }
        localStorage.setItem('items',JSON.stringify(item))  // if not converted to string, browser will store something like [object object]
        let getItem = localStorage.getItem('items')   // this will return the object in strings. To use it, convert it into object.
        JSON.parse(getItem) // converted back into object.

        // same syntax for sessionStorage.

        // task -  create a login page. Get inputs from user like, username, email, password. Create an object using these 
        // information and save it in broswer. Later when you close the tab or entire browser, the data should be deleted.

        // also keep a button. store the same data using localStorage. Once the button is clicked, the data in localStorage
        //  should be deleted
